## ⚡ Fun facts (AKA, get to know me better):

- I make bread. Well, to be more accurate: I make dough. Carbs rule everything around me. I love making sourdough bread, pizza dough, English muffins, and all types of pastas. I also have made tartlettes, scones, and soft pretzels.
- I used to weld and do sheetmetal work in a factory and now I write code. It was quite a jump.
- I've been to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We had a team there that I trained on a new software our company started using.
